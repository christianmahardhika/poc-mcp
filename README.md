# POC MCP (Model Context Protocol)

# Description

This is a proof of concept (POC) for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The MCP is a protocol for managing the context of large language models (LLMs) in a way that allows for efficient and effective use of the model's capabilities. The MCP is designed to be used in conjunction with the Model Context API (MCA), which provides a set of tools and interfaces for interacting with LLMs.
